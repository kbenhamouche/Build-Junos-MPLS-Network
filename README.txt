REQUIREMENTS
- ssh has to be enabled
- devices have to be reachable via the Management IP address

FILES TO CHANGE for your topology:
- hosts.inv
- topology.yml

BACKUP config:
- The process already included a backup of configuration files generated by the "Push-Config-pb.yml" playbook.
- However, you can backup the existing config on device by using the "Backup-pb.yml" playbook before to execute the process.

PROCESS:
Execute step by step the following playbooks:
- Step1-GenIPs-pb.yml
- Step2-GenVARs-pb.yml
- Step3-Push-Config-pb.yml

In the "Step3-Push-Config-pb.yml" playbook, you can change the following sequence to generate and push configuration on devices.

1- Generate configuration for IGP protocols (IS-IS or OSPF) - Select: 05-generate-ospf OR 05-generate-isis (default)
2- Generate configuration for label protocols (LDP or RSVP) - Select: 06-generate-ldp OR 06-generate-rsvp (default)
3- Generate configuration for MPLS interfaces
4- Generate configuration for MP-BGP - Select: 08-generate-mpbgp-with-RR (default) and 08-generate-mpbgp-without-RR
5- Generate common configuration for all nodes
6- Generate configuration for L3VPN - coming soon
7- Generate configuration for EVPN - coming soon
8- Generate configuration for MVPN - coming soon
9- Generate configuration for QoS - coming soon

Finally, the roles/merge-config consolidates all generated configurations in order to create the final configuration for each node.
